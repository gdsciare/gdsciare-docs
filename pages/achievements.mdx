### GDC Fellowship - Ashraf Mohammed

- Sponsored by **Pupilfirst India**

**How did he get the internship?**

My journey started with my enrollment in the AICTE Lite Web Development Course, a program designed for learning full-stack development skills. The course demanded attention, particularly in successfully completing the foundational WD101 and advanced WD201 courses. The first focused on frontend and the latter backend, a crucial step toward eligibility for the GDC Internship. Once I became a WD201 graduate, I was eligible for the GDC internship where the first round was a coding task and the second an interview. I passed both happily, and after a few days, received the good news that I was selected for this internship.

**Prerequisites for the internship**

The GDC Fellowship is attainable by having a firm grasp of key web development languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, coupled with good knowledge in backend creation. The Fellowship's selection process, as of now, only allows WD201 graduates.
