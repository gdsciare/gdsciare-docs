## Overview

**GDSC IARE** is an institution-exclusive chapter of **Google Developer Student Clubs**, driven by passionate students from our college.

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSCs) are university-based community groups powered by Google Developers for students interested in the latest technologies. The aim is to help students bridge the gap between theory and practice. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. We aim at solving real life problems by building tech projects using the best of technologies, and create an impact around.

This community was first started in **August 2022** by **Ujjwal Shivacharya**, when he was selected as the first GDSC Lead at IARE, Hyderabad. Since then, the community has grown exponentially in providing value-driven content and promoting latest technologies amongst all its tech-savvy members. With 1000s of views in engagement, GDSC IARE is helping several budding developers connect with industry leaders, and network with like minded people from other GDSCs.
