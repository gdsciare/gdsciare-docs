## Overview

**GDSC IARE** is an institution-exclusive chapter of **Google Developer Student Clubs** driven by passionate students from our college.

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are university-based community groups powered by Google Developers for students interested in Technology. The aim is to help students bridge the gap between theory and practice. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their communities.
